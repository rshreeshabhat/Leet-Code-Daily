# 36. Valid Sudoku

## Problem Statement

Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character `'.'`.

## Example

```plaintext
Input: board = 
[
    ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
    ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
    [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
    ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
    ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
    ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
    [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
    [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
    [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```

## Constraints

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to check three conditions for each cell in the Sudoku board:
1. The digit must not be repeated in the current row.
2. The digit must not be repeated in the current column.
3. The digit must not be repeated in the current 3x3 sub-box.

We can use three sets to keep track of the digits we have seen so far for each row, column, and sub-box.

```python
def isValidSudoku(board):
        rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        boxes = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        
        for r in range(9):
                for c in range(9):
                        if board[r][c] == '.':
                                continue
                        if (board[r][c] in rows[r] or 
                                board[r][c] in cols[c] or 
                                board[r][c] in boxes[(r // 3) * 3 + (c // 3)]):
                                return False
                        rows[r].add(board[r][c])
                        cols[c].add(board[r][c])
                        boxes[(r // 3) * 3 + (c // 3)].add(board[r][c])
        
        return True
```
