# 1780. Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is possible to represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Example

```markdown
### Example 1:
**Input:** n = 12
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 12 = 3^1 + 3^2

### Example 2:
**Input:** n = 91
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 91 = 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4

### Example 3:
**Input:** n = 21
**Output:** false
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^7`

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start with the largest power of three that is less than or equal to `n` and subtract it from `n`. We repeat this process until `n` becomes zero. If at any point `n` becomes negative, we return `false`.

```python
def checkPowersOfThree(n: int) -> bool:
    power = 1
    while power <= n:
        power *= 3
    power //= 3
    
    while n > 0:
        if n >= power:
            n -= power
        power //= 3
    
    return n == 0
```
