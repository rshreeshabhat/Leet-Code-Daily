# 1415. The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n

## Problem Statement

A happy string is a string that:

1. Consists only of letters of the set `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
2. `s[i] != s[i + 1]` for all values of `i` from `1` to `s.length - 1` (string is 1-indexed).

Given two integers `n` and `k`, consider a list of all happy strings of length `n` sorted in lexicographical order. Return the `k`-th string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than `k` happy strings of length `n`.

## Example

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1, k = 3
Output: "c"
Explanation: The list of happy strings of length 1 is ["a", "b", "c"]. The 3rd string is "c".
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, k = 4
Output: ""
Explanation: There are only 3 happy strings of length 1.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3, k = 9
Output: "cab"
Explanation: The list of happy strings of length 3 is ["aba", "abc", "aca", "acb", "bab", "bca", "bcb", "cab", "cac"]. The 9th string is "cab".
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10`
- `1 <= k <= 100`

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach to generate all happy strings of length `n` and then sort them lexicographically. Once we have the sorted list, we can simply return the `k`-th string if it exists.

```python
def getHappyString(n: int, k: int) -> str:
    def backtrack(current):
        if len(current) == n:
            result.append(current)
            return
        for char in 'abc':
            if not current or current[-1] != char:
                backtrack(current + char)
    
    result = []
    backtrack("")
    result.sort()
    
    return result[k - 1] if k <= len(result) else ""

# Example usage:
# n = 3, k = 9
# print(getHappyString(3, 9))  # Output: "cab"
```
