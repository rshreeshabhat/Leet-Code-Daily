# 1. Two Sum

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Example

```markdown
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Solution

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in hashmap:
            return [hashmap[complement], i]
        hashmap[num] = i
```
