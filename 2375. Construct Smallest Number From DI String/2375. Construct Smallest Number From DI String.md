# 2375. Construct Smallest Number From DI String

## Problem Statement

Given a string `pattern` of length `n` consisting of the characters 'I' (increase) and 'D' (decrease), construct the lexicographically smallest permutation of the numbers [1, 2, ..., n+1] that matches the given pattern.

## Example

### Example 1:
```
Input: pattern = "IDID"
Output: "13254"
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: pattern = "III"
Output: "1234"
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: pattern = "DDI"
Output: "3214"
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= pattern.length <= 100`
- `pattern` consists of only the characters 'I' and 'D'.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will iterate through the pattern and construct the permutation step by step, ensuring that we always choose the smallest possible number that satisfies the current condition ('I' or 'D').

## Pseudocode

```
function constructSmallestNumber(pattern):
    n = length(pattern)
    result = []
    stack = []
    
    for i from 0 to n:
        stack.push(i + 1)
        if i == n or pattern[i] == 'I':
            while stack is not empty:
                result.append(stack.pop())
    
    return join(result)
```

## Implementation

```python
def constructSmallestNumber(pattern: str) -> str:
    n = len(pattern)
    result = []
    stack = []
    
    for i in range(n + 1):
        stack.append(i + 1)
        if i == n or pattern[i] == 'I':
            while stack:
                result.append(stack.pop())
    
    return ''.join(map(str, result))
```
