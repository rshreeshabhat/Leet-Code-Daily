# 2364. Count Number of Bad Pairs

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, a pair `(i, j)` is called a bad pair if `i < j` and `j - i != nums[j] - nums[i]`. Your task is to count the number of bad pairs in the array.

## Example

```markdown
### Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,1,3,3]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 bad pairs: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3)

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no bad pairs.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to keep track of the counts of `nums[i] - i` values. By iterating through the array and updating the hashmap, we can efficiently count the number of bad pairs.

```python
def countBadPairs(nums):
    count = 0
    freq = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = num - i
        if diff in freq:
            count += i - freq[diff]
            freq[diff] += 1
        else:
            count += i
            freq[diff] = 1
    return count
```
