# 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length, return `true` if you can swap two letters in `s1` so that the result is equal to `s2`, otherwise return `false`.

## Example

```markdown
**Example 1:**

Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap 'b' and 'k' in "bank" to get "kanb".

**Example 2:**

Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot make "attack" equal to "defend" with any swaps.

**Example 3:**

Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
Output: true
Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no swaps are needed.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
- `s1.length == s2.length`
- `s1` and `s2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to check if we can make the two strings equal by swapping exactly one pair of characters in `s1`. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. If `s1` is already equal to `s2`, return `true`.
2. Find all the positions where `s1` and `s2` differ.
3. If there are exactly two positions where they differ, check if swapping these two characters in `s1` makes it equal to `s2`.
4. If the conditions are met, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

```python
def areAlmostEqual(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    if s1 == s2:
        return True
    
    diff = [(a, b) for a, b in zip(s1, s2) if a != b]
    
    return len(diff) == 2 and diff[0] == diff[1][::-1]
```
