# 3105. Longest Strictly Increasing or Strictly Decreasing Subarray

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest subarray that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

## Example

```markdown
Input: [1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 1, 6, 7]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest subarray is [5, 4, 2, 1] which is strictly decreasing.
```

## Constraints

- The array length will be between 1 and 10^5.
- The array elements will be between -10^9 and 10^9.

## Approach

1. Initialize two variables to keep track of the current length of increasing and decreasing subarrays.
2. Iterate through the array and update the lengths based on the comparison of consecutive elements.
3. Keep track of the maximum length encountered during the iteration.

## Solution

```python
def longest_subarray(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0

    inc = dec = max_len = 1

    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            inc += 1
            dec = 1
        elif arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            dec += 1
            inc = 1
        else:
            inc = dec = 1

        max_len = max(max_len, inc, dec)

    return max_len
```
