# 1726. Tuple with Same Product

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of distinct positive integers, return the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` such that `a * b = c * d` where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct elements in `nums`.

## Example

```markdown
**Input:** nums = [2, 3, 4, 6]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** There are 8 valid tuples:
(2, 6, 3, 4), (2, 6, 4, 3), (6, 2, 3, 4), (6, 2, 4, 3)
(3, 4, 2, 6), (3, 4, 6, 2), (4, 3, 2, 6), (4, 3, 6, 2)
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- All elements in `nums` are distinct.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a hash map to store the product of every pair of elements in the array. For each product, we count how many pairs produce that product. Then, for each product that appears more than once, we calculate the number of valid tuples.

```python
def tupleSameProduct(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict
    product_count = defaultdict(int)
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            product = nums[i] * nums[j]
            product_count[product] += 1
    
    result = 0
    for count in product_count.values():
        if count > 1:
            result += count * (count - 1) // 2 * 8
    
    return result
```

## Explanation

1. We use a nested loop to calculate the product of every pair of elements in the array and store the count of each product in a hash map.
2. For each product that appears more than once, we calculate the number of valid tuples using the formula `count * (count - 1) // 2 * 8`, where `count` is the number of pairs that produce the same product.
3. Finally, we return the total number of valid tuples.
