# 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

## Problem Statement

Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use the two-pointer technique:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the end of the array.
2. Calculate the sum of the elements at the `left` and `right` pointers.
3. If the sum is equal to the target, return the indices `[left + 1, right + 1]`.
4. If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to the right.
5. If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to the left.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the solution is found.

```python
def twoSum(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
```
