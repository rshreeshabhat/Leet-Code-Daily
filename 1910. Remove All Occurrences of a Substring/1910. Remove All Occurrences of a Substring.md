# 1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `part`, perform the following operation on `s` until `s` no longer contains the substring `part`:
- Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring `part` and remove it from `s`.

Return `s` after removing all occurrences of `part`.

### Example

**Input:**
```
s = "daabcbaabcbc"
part = "abc"
```

**Output:**
```
"dab"
```

**Explanation:**
- Remove the first occurrence of "abc" from "daabcbaabcbc", we get "dabaabcbc".
- Remove the first occurrence of "abc" from "dabaabcbc", we get "dababc".
- Remove the first occurrence of "abc" from "dababc", we get "dab".

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= part.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `part` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a loop to repeatedly find and remove the substring `part` from `s` until it no longer exists in `s`.

### Pseudocode

```
while part in s:
    s = s.replace(part, "", 1)
return s
```

### Implementation

```python
def removeOccurrences(s: str, part: str) -> str:
    while part in s:
        s = s.replace(part, "", 1)
    return s
```
