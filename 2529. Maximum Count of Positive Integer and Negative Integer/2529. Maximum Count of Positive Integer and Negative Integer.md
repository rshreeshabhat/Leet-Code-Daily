# 2529. Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the maximum count of positive integers and negative integers in the array.

## Example

```markdown
Input: [-1, -2, -3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 positive integers (4, 5, 6) and 3 negative integers (-1, -2, -3). The maximum count is 3.
```

## Constraints

- The array will contain at least one integer.
- The integers can be both positive and negative.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and count the number of positive and negative integers. The maximum count will be the higher of the two counts.

```python
def max_count(nums):
    positive_count = 0
    negative_count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > 0:
            positive_count += 1
        elif num < 0:
            negative_count += 1
    
    return max(positive_count, negative_count)

# Example usage
nums = [-1, -2, -3, 4, 5, 6]
print(max_count(nums))  # Output: 3
```
