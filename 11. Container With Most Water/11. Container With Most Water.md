# 11. Container With Most Water

## Problem Statement

Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an`, where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` are at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

## Example

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (between lines 8 and 7) the container can contain is 49.
```

## Constraints

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use the two-pointer technique. We initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array. We then calculate the area formed between the two lines and move the pointer which is at the shorter line towards the other pointer, updating the maximum area found so far.

```python
def maxArea(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0
    
    while left < right:
        width = right - left
        max_area = max(max_area, min(height[left], height[right]) * width)
        
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return max_area
```
